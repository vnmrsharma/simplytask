## üåü **Core Features**

Whether you're on your phone, tablet, or computer, everything looks and feels just right. The interface adapts to your device so you can stay productive anywhere.

### üîí **Your Data, Your Privacy**
Built with Supabase for rock-solid security and your OpenAI interactions happen through secure serverless functions. Your personal information never leaves secure, encrypted environments.

### üéØ **Smart Categories & Priorities**
Create custom categories that make sense for your life and work. The system learns your patterns and helps suggest the right priority levels for different types of tasks.

## üöÄ **Getting Started Locally**

Want to run this on your own machine? Here's how to get everything set up - don't worry, it's easier than it looks!

### **Step 1: Get Your Free API Keys**

You'll need a couple of free accounts (seriously, they're free):

**Supabase** (for storing your tasks securely)
1. Head to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create an account
2. Create a new project (give it any name you like)
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí API and grab your:
   - Project URL (starts with `https://`)
   - `anon/public` key (the long string)

**OpenAI** (for Donna's AI magic)
1. Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and sign up
2. Go to API Keys section and create a new key
3. Copy that key somewhere safe (you'll need it in a minute)

### **Step 2: Clone and Set Up the Project**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd to-do

# Install all the dependencies
npm install
```

### **Step 3: Configure Your Environment**

Create a file called `.env.local` in the main project folder and add your keys:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Important**: Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` signs, and replace the placeholder text with your actual keys!

### **Step 4: Set Up Your Database**

The database setup is super simple with Supabase:

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250723155509_golden_cottage.sql`
3. Paste it into the SQL Editor and run it
4. That's it! Your database is ready to go.

### **Step 5: Run the App**

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see SimplyTask ready to help you get organized!

### **Step 6: Test Donna**

Try saying something like:
- "Hey Donna! How are you?"
- "Schedule a meeting with the team at 2 PM today"
- "I'm feeling overwhelmed with my schedule"

She should respond naturally and help you out!

## üåê **Deploying to Production**

When you're ready to share this with the world (or just want it running 24/7 for yourself):

### **Deploy to Vercel** (Recommended - it's free!)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repo to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. **CRITICAL**: Add the same environment variables in your Vercel project settings:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. Deploy!

Vercel will automatically handle the serverless functions and make Donna work perfectly in production.

## üõ† **Tech Stack** (For the Curious)

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini via Vercel serverless functions / feel free to use any or write me an email I can share a small model I created derived from LLama 3.0 that can run locally on your system.
- **Charts**: Recharts for beautiful data visualization
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend + serverless functions)

## üí° **Tips for the Best Experience**

- **Be Natural**: Talk to Donna like you would a human assistant
- **Try Different Views**: Switch between calendar views to find what works for you
- **Check Your Reports**: The AI summaries are actually motivating and helpful
- **Use Categories**: Create categories that make sense for your workflow
- **Trust the Conflict Detection**: When Donna says there's a conflict, listen to her!

## ü§î **Need Help?**

If something's not working right, here are the most common fixes:

- **Donna isn't responding**: Check that your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- **Tasks aren't saving**: Verify your Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
- **Charts look weird**: Make sure you ran the database migration
- **Local development issues**: Try running `vercel dev` instead of `npm run dev`

## üéâ **That's It!**

You now have your own AI-powered productivity assistant running locally. Donna is ready to help you get organized, stay motivated, and actually enjoy managing your tasks.

Remember: this isn't just about getting things done - it's about making the process of staying organized actually pleasant. Enjoy! ‚ú®
